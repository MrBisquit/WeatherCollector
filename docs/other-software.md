| [WeatherCollector_TimelapseCreator](#weathercollector_timelapsecreator) | MrBisquit (Me) | Creates a timelapse from your photos & data. |

## Weather-Monitor
An open source bit of firmware for the M5Stack Core2 that fetches data and shows it to you.<br>
Here's the [link to the GitHub repository](https://github.com/MrBisquit/Weather-Monitor).

## WeatherCollector_TimelapseCreator
An open source bit of software for Windows (I don't think you can run it on anything else because it uses `System.Drawing.Common`) that can create timelapses based on your images and data fetched from your WeatherCollector instance.<br>
Here's the [link to the GitHub repository](https://github.com/MrBisquit/WeatherCollector_TimelapseCreator).

# Data sizes

> [!NOTE]
> This is the rounded version of the information, for more precise information, please follow [this link](external-drive-precise.md).
> This may be easier to look at and understand than the precise information.

On average a picture is 1 MB (Depending on the camera you use, quality and a few other things, but its a rough average.)

> [!NOTE]
> This is also assuming that you're only using one collector, to calculate how much storage you'll need for multiple collectors, multiply the correct row/column by the amount of collectors.
